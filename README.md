# Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict diseases based on symptoms using machine learning techniques. It includes a trained Random Forest model and a web-based application for user interaction.

## Project Structure
- **`app.py`** - Main application script for running the web app.
- **`disease_prediction_project.ipynb`** - Jupyter notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **`disease prediction data set.csv`** - Dataset used for training the model.
- **`diseases_with_specialists.csv`** - List of diseases and corresponding specialists.
- **`Symptom-severity.csv`** - Symptom severity levels for analysis.
- **`random_forest_model.pkl`** - Pre-trained machine learning model for disease prediction.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage
- Open the web application in a browser.
- Input symptoms to get a predicted disease.
- View suggested specialists for further consultation.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- Flask (for the web app)
- Pandas (for data handling)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning)
- NumPy (for numerical computations)
